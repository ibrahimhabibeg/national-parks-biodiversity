# National Parks Biodiversity Analysis
This repository contains data and Jupyter Notebook for an analysis of species in the National Parks Service.

## About the Project
This project is part of the Data Scientist: Machine Learning Professional Certificate offered by Codecademy. It analyzes a dataset about species in the National Parks Service. The data explores the number of sightings of various species across different parks.

The Jupyter notebook included, "national-parks-biodiversity.ipynb",  performs the following analysis:

- Merges two datasets - one on observations of species in National Parks and another on species information.
- Cleans and prepares the data for analysis
- Analyzes the data to answer questions about National Park biodiversity

## Data

This repository contains the following data files:

- observations.csv: This file contains data about recorded sightings of different species at several national parks for the past 7 days.
- species_info.csv: This file contains data about different species and their conservation status.

## Using the Jupyter Notebook

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open "National Parks Biodiversity.ipynb" in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
3. Run the notebook cells to execute the code and view the analysis.

The notebook requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

These libraries can be installed using the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Conclusion
- The Yellowstone Park observed the largest amount of animals and plants in the 7 days of data recording
- The vascular plant is the most commonly observed category in the National Parks surpassing any other category with a huge difference
- We should prioritize protecting mammals

## Acknowledgment
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the Codecademy team for their exceptional course and comprehensive explanations.
